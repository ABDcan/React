1.what is cdn and why do we use it?
Ans-> A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications1. When a user visits a website, data from that website’s server has to travel across the internet to reach the user’s computer. If the user is located far from that server, it will take a long time to load a large file, such as a video or website image1. To solve this problem, the website content is stored on CDN servers that are geographically closer to the users, allowing the content to reach their computers much faster1.

The primary purpose of a CDN is to reduce latency, or the delay in communication created by a network’s design1. A CDN improves efficiency by introducing intermediary servers between the client and the website server1. These CDN servers manage some of the client-server communications, decrease web traffic to the web server, reduce bandwidth consumption, and improve the user experience of your applications1.
The benefits of using a CDN include:

Reducing page load time: A CDN can reduce bounce rates and increase the time users spend on your site.
Reducing bandwidth costs: Through caching and other optimizations, CDNs can reduce the amount of data an origin server must provide, reducing the costs of hosting for website owners.
Increasing content availability and redundancy: CDN services can handle more web traffic and reduce the load on web servers. Also, if one or more CDN servers go offline, other operational servers can replace them to ensure uninterrupted service.
Improving website security: A CDN may improve security by providing DDoS mitigation, improvements to security certificates, and other optimizations.
